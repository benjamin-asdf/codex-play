My explorations of [[https://beta.openai.com/][openai api]] using babashka.

It is doing it, which is sort of exiting:

#+begin_src clojure
(openai-edit
 {:model "code-davinci-edit-001"
  :instruction "Remove redundant let, preserve bindings from all let. Fix whitespace."
  :input  (prn-str '(let [foo 10] (let [bar 11] (+ foo bar))))})
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure
(let [foo 10
      bar 11]
  (+ foo bar))
#+end_src

(Nbb also worked but their node client doesn't even have edits yet).

You need to provid an api-key.

I will play around with putting what openai provides into emacs.

** goals

- Completion and edit are separate modules, provide both
- Provide a to define commands, the power comes from engeneering the prompt
- Also make it easy to use the other models for text (org mode,
  markdown mode)
- Make different commands for separate use cases.
  - capf for completion of next few words
  - complete with region that is allowed to run a bit longer

[[https://github.com/debanjum/codex-completion][codex-completion]] package is not up to date anymore.
