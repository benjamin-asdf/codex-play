My explorations of [[https://beta.openai.com/][openai api]] using babashka.

It is doing it:

#+begin_src clojure
(openai-edit
 {:model "code-davinci-edit-001"
  :instruction "Remove redundant let"
  :input (prn-str '(let [foo 10] (let [bar 11] (+ foo bar))))})

(get *1 "text")

"(let [foo 10] (+ foo 11))\n"
#+end_src



(Nbb also worked but their node client doesn't even have edits yet).

You need to provid an api-key.

I will play around with putting what openai provides into emacs.

[[https://github.com/debanjum/codex-completion][codex-completion]] package is not up to date anymore.
